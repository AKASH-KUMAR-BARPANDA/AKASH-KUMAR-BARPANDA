###  Featured Projects

1. **[Tune-ID API](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Tune-ID_API)**  
   A FastAPI-powered music recognition system that identifies the closest matching song from an uploaded audio file. It extracts MFCC features using Librosa, stores them in a JSON database, and applies cosine similarity to match queries.

2. **[HAWK-CRICKET-AI](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/HAWK-CRICKET-AI)**  
   *(Under development)* A theme to predict scores, wickets, etc., in cricket using AI.

3. **[Bigram Model](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Bigram_model)**  
   A Python implementation of a bigram language model, featuring text preprocessing, frequency counting, probability estimation, and tools for next-word prediction and sentence generation to demonstrate core language modeling concepts.

4. **[PYLLM](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/PYLLM)**  
   Bigram Language Model using PyTorch. It demonstrates token embeddings, forward propagation, loss calculation, and text generation from scratch. Designed for learning and experimentation, the code highlights core concepts of neural language models and provides a foundation for building more advanced NLP architectures.

5. **[ChatBot API](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/ChatBot_API)**  
   chatBot_api is a lightweight chatbot backend built with FastAPI and Pydantic. It offers RESTful endpoints for handling chat requests, data validation, and easy integration with apps. Scalable, fast, and ready for custom chatbot logic.

6. **[Weather Prediction using ML](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Weather_prediction_using_ML)**  
   A machine learning model that predicts weather conditions based on historical data.

7. **[Hand Tracking](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Hand_Tracking)**  
   Real-time hand tracking using computer vision techniques.

8. **[Blinkit UI using Flutter](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Blinkit_UI_Flutter)**  
   A UI clone of Blinkit (formerly Grofers) built using Flutter, showcasing responsive design and state management.

9. **[Spotify Clone with Clean Architecture](https://github.com/AKASH-KUMAR-BARPANDA/Spotify_Clone_Clean_Architecture)**  
   *(Under development)* A Spotify clone application with a focus on clean architecture and business-level logic design.
